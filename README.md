# Introduction

The blockchain is a revolutionary technology that is transforming how people communicate and share information. Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are built on the blockchain technology, which is the most well-known implementation of the blockchain. But the blockchain is more than just a cryptocurrency; it's a game-changing technology that's revolutionising the way people communicate and share information. The blockchain is an open, distributed ledger technology that was first used in the Bitcoin cryptocurrency. A decentralised Digital Database, meaning it is not controlled by a single entity or group.

The world is getting increasingly digital as social media continues to impact the way we communicate, share ideas, and feel connected to one another. The present social landscape is becoming increasingly centralised, with only a few corporations dominating our online interactions. This has resulted in a web of privacy and censorship problems, as well as a failure to serve the needs of the many people in our society who do not have internet access. Instead of going down the same path, we may work together to create a better future.

Decentralised social media is growing in popularity, as social media behemoths like Facebook and Twitter lose their hold on consumers. Mastodon, the first decentralised social media platform, was launched in 2016, and since then, a slew of other sites have emerged to offer consumers an alternative to the current social media ecosystem.

The next step in social media is decentralised social technology. It is a platform that lets users to freely share information while remaining independent of any particular entity. Users can openly share information and opinions on platforms like Paradigm without fear of censorship or bias. It also provides a cost-effective learning environment for students and organisations to learn and flourish.

It's no secret that social media has changed how we communicate, connect, and exchange information. Facebook and Twitter have been equated with social media for the past decade. However, a new form of decentralised social media is gaining traction. Decentralised social-media platforms have a decentralised architecture, which means that no single company or organisation owns or manages the platform.

Today, decentralised social media platforms are gaining traction. Many people are attracted to the idea of a social network that is not controlled by a huge organisation. Decentralised social media platforms operate on a peer-to-peer network, which means they are not controlled by a single firm or entity. They're frequently built to be as transparent as possible, so consumers can see where their information is stored and how it's being utilised.

Users can exchange information and thoughts without fear of censorship or bias as a result of this. It also gives users a safe haven where they may freely share information and resources without fear of being sued or having their personal information disclosed without their permission. Users give storage space and processing power to the platform in exchange for access to a social platform. This prevents the platform from being controlled by a single party and assures that it is free of censorship and bias. Decentralised social-media systems, rather than relying on a large firm to administer them, are run by the users themselves.



## Virtual Learning Platform Designed for the Crypto Ecosystem

Yumpie emerges as the solution to the four industrial issues discussed in the introduction, despite the failures of innumerable efforts. Yumpie is poised to create a one-stop crypto ecosystem that connects global crypto projects and communities by employing the concept of social media as its base. 

Moreover, because of Steemit's success as the first decentralised publishing platform, many other platforms have attempted to replicate its success. Real-time chat, custom emotes integration, and other platform features and functionalities are severely limited by the UI of a blogging platform. Because user involvement is so undervalued, many platforms fall short of delivering a genuine community-building effort.

> The lack of a clear frontrunner in the crypto social media environment indicates that existing platforms are failing to pique the interest of global bitcoin groups. Yumpie determined that the one thing that blockchain users are interested in is none other than Cryptocurrency and Blockchain Technology, after reflecting on the faults of these platforms.

Yumpie purports to be the first social media network to promote the concept of cryptocurrency-focused content. Yumpie has been able to build a community of predominantly digital currencies by focusing the group's interests. The strong niche integration will bring additional cryptocurrency enthusiasts and ventures to the service as the community grows.

Yumpie also abandons the traditional blogging approach in favour of developing a new ui framework with more feature scalability. Yumpie will evolve into a fast-growing and sustainable ecosystem as more users and ventures join the network, allowing for the easy integration of comprehensive features and capabilities that benefit the crypto ecosystem.

### Problem Statement

Yumpie emerges as the solution to the four industry issues discussed in the introduction, despite the failures of other attempts. Yumpie is poised to create a one-stop crypto ecosystem that connects global crypto projects and communities by employing the concept of social media as its base.

Although there have been several crypto communities already existing before to Yumpie’s inception, Yumpie was one of few crypto community platforms that did it right.  This is because most platforms, focus their efforts on promote concepts such as "censorship-resistance," "free speech," and "data-privacy," which are not well received by the crypto community. What is the point of having so many similar platforms, the community realises?

To gateway the ability to integrate projects and communities under a unified ecosystem and Yumpie offers a solution to the following four industry dilemmas:

1.	A scenario in which one side of a business arrangement has more information than the other party. In as much as information and knowledge about the blockchain and cryptocurrency industries are not shared uniformly and consistently throughout networks, Schemes unfavourable to the masses have proliferated in the crypto world.

2.	During a bear market, most cryptocurrency start-ups are continually looking for the most cost-effective strategy to raise exposure in the industry. Using traditional channels such as outreach activities and sponsored advertising to promote a project is brilliant but an ineffective investment, nonetheless.

3.	The crypto community struggles to stay focused on one platform due to the widespread use of several social media platforms such as Twitter, Telegram, and Discord. This segmentation has a significant resources and monetary impact, as well as a significant level of community severance.

4.	Most tokens and crypto projects rely on excitement to stay afloat in the market, with little to no utility. Unsurprisingly, the value of most 2017 tokens plummeted to dangerous lows, resulting in a major decline in market interest and the start of a bear market. With newcomers entering the crypto space every day, adoption is once again a faraway fantasy.

5. The more programmes you install on a hard drive, the more components your system has to utilize. The more you use your computer, the faster it ages. Yes, the PC will slow down if you install extra software that runs in the background. Some applications may start up with your computer, slowing down the time it takes for it to boot up. On the other side, you might not be able to afford the software required to reach a goal.

### Solution

Yumpie purports to be the first social media network to promote the notion of cryptocurrency-focused content. Yumpie can build a community of predominantly cryptocurrency users by balancing the community's interests. The strong specialised network effect will bring additional cryptocurrency users and projects to the platform as the project continues.

Yumpie notably abandons the traditional blogosphere experience in favour of developing a new interface architecture centred around scalability. Yumpie will ultimately evolve into a fast-growing and scalable ecosystem as more users and projects join the platform, allowing for the easy integration of various features and capabilities that benefit the blockchain industry.

The ability to integrate projects and communities under a unified ecosystem offers a solution to the industry’s crucial quandaries:

1.	Yumpie's ecosystem will become a primary source of market intelligence for both blockchain and non-blockchain whenever vantures and people are brought together. Each ecosystem member, particularly novices, may readily access a wealth of information that validates exploratory findings in real time.
2.	Yumpie may be used as a brand-new marketing funnel to generate the most cost-effective visibility and exposure by developing a central social community space for cryptocurrency users. With Yumpie's features like advertising and promoted posts, projects no longer need to rely on the market's existing costly marketing options.
3.	Yumpie's community is primarily comprised of cryptocurrency users, fostering a significant asymmetric encryption network effect. Yumpie will be used by blockchain communities to maintain engagement between one another as the ecosystem develops stronger, eliminating the need for existing social networks such As facebook, Twitter, and Telegram.
4.	Yumpie's embrace of the latest crypto developments, such as DeFi and NFT, is a strong instance of how it expands the ecosystem's use cases. YUM , the ecosystem's principal medium of exchange, will become one of the widely used assets in the crypto market as the ecosystem grows. In comparison to other tokens, YUM is able to retain such a sustainable growth potential due to its increased utilisation potential due to the size of the community.

The concept of leveraging a social media platform gives rise to a linear and scalable business model in contrary to the concept of “Do Things that Don’t Scale”. Yumpie’s ecosystem is made up of several use cases. The utility of YUM and revenue generated by the ecosystem will increase at a cumulative proportion as the ecosystem grows. The greater the incentive and reward funnelled back to each YUM holder, the more money and utility the ecosystem can accumulate. The ecosystem does not have the scalability element to thrive in the bull run and maintain in the bear run without a social media element.

Despite the failures of numerous attempts by would be coming projects, Yumpie emerges as the solution to common development concerns. Yumpie is on track to build a one-stop crypto ecosystem that uses social media as its foundation to connect worldwide enterprises and communities.
